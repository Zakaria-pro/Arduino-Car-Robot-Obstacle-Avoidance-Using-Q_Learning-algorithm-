# Arduino-Car-Robot-Obstacle-Avoidance-Using-Q_Learning-algorithm-
It's a robot car that learn to avoid obstacles from it's environement, we have used a Reinforcement Machine Learning algorithm called Q Learning. 

## Used hardware : 
* DC Motor
* L298N : driver of DC motors
* Arduino Uno
* Motor shield : getting more pins
* HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor : calculating distance
* Servo motor : turning the HC-SR04 Sensor
* Bluetooth module : Debuging code
* 2 Cerle Wheels and 1 Spherical Wheel 
* Chassis 
* Power supply
